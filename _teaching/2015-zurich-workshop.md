A BEAST workshop going through two methods of calibrating temporal phylogenies:

* Tip date calibration.
* Node date calibration.

Course materials are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/22kkof7882dgn5z/Alien_dating.pdf?dl=0).
The idea behind this workshop was to use simulated data with a humorous twist to avoid getting sidetracked with biology and keep it light-hearted and interesting.
