# Run this from the _talks/ directory, which contains .md files of all your talks.
# This scrapes the location YAML field from each .md file, geolocates it with
# geopy/Nominatim, and uses the getorg library to output data, HTML,
# and Javascript for a standalone cluster map.
#
# Requires: glob, getorg, geopy
