The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa witnessed considerable efforts to obtain viral genomic data as the epidemic was unfolding.
If such data can be deployed in real-time, molecular epidemiological investigations can take up a critical role in complementing contact tracing efforts by public health agencies.
Analysing the accumulated EBOV genetic data can also deliver important insights into epidemic dynamics, as demonstrated by a recent viral genome study that revealed a metapopulation pattern of spread.
Although metapopulation dynamics were critical for connecting rural and urban areas during the epidemic, the implications for specific intervention scenarios remain unclear. Here, we address this question using a collection of phylodynamic approaches.
We show that long-distance dispersal events (between administrative areas >250 km apart) were not crucial for epidemic expansion and that preventing viral lineage movement to a specific administrative area would, in most cases, have had little impact.
In addition, urban areas - specifically those encompassing the three capital cities and their suburbs - were critical in attracting and further disseminating the virus, and preventing viral lineage movement to all three simultaneously would have contained epidemic size to about one third.
Using continuous phylogeographic reconstructions we estimate a distance kernel for EBOV spread and reveal considerable heterogeneity in dispersal velocity through time.
We also show that announcements of border closures were followed by a significant but transient effect on international virus dispersal.
By quantifying the hypothetical impact of different intervention strategies as well as the impact of barriers on dispersal frequency, our study illustrates how phylodynamic analyses can help to address specific epidemiological and outbreak control questions.
