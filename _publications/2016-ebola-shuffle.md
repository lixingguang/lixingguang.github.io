Hoenen et al. (Reports, 3 April 2015, p. 117; published online 26 March) suggested that the Ebola virus Makona responsible for the West African epidemic evolved more slowly than previously reported.
We show that this was based on corrupted data. An erratum provided a rate compatible with the initial and later, more precise, estimates but did not correctly state the nature of the error.
