Members of the genus Ebolavirus have caused outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever in humans in Africa.
The most recent outbreak in Guinea, which began in February of 2014, is still ongoing.
Recently published analyses of sequences from this outbreak suggest that the outbreak in Guinea is caused by a divergent lineage of Zaire ebolavirus.
We report evidence that points to the same Zaire ebolavirus lineage that has previously caused outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Gabon as the culprit behind the outbreak in Guinea.
